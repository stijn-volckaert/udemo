                      Unreal Tournament Demo Manager 3.6    
                by UsAaR33 (until v3.0) and AnthraX (after v3.0)
		
===============================================================================

1) Description
--------------

UsAaR33's UT demo manager adds a lot of functionality to the Unreal Tournament
demo recording and playback system. Some of the key features are:
* A convenient demo browser that lists demos + packages required to play them
* A uz downloader that can download and install packages required for playback
* Commands to record, stop, rename, and delete demos
* 3rd person demo playback
* Demo speed control, seeking, pausing, ...
* ... and many many more (see OriginalReadme.txt for an overview)

Demo Manager 3.6 is an updated version of the original UT demo manager. While
the interface and functionality hasn't changed much, demo manager 3.6 does
include a lot of fixes for rendering glitches, crashes, etc. It also restores a
lot of functionality that broke because of anti-cheat tools such as UTPure,
UTDC, AnthChecker, ACE, etc.

Demo Manager is an open source mod. The code is available at:
https://github.com/stijn-volckaert/udemo

I am accepting pull requests!

2) Installation
---------------

1) Extract every file to the system directory of Unreal Tournament. (e.g.,
c:\unrealtournament\system)

2) Run UnrealTournament
3) Open Demo manager via game mod menu
4) Change demo driver to "udemo" and restart game

or do the same by manual edit ini files:

2) Open Unrealtournament.ini (in the system directory)
3) Find the line that says DemoRecordingDevice=Engine.DemoRecDriver
4) Change it to: DemoRecordingDevice=udemo.uDemoDriver

Failure to perform steps 2-4 will prevent usage of the speed control, pausing,
seeking, or any other nice feature of the new demo driver!
